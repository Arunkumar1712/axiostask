Project Name:
React Axios CRUD Application

Description
The React Axios CRUD Application is a web application designed to demonstrate how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Axios in a React application. It allows users to interact with a mock API to create, retrieve, update, and delete data. The project aims to provide developers with a practical example of integrating Axios, a popular HTTP client for JavaScript, with React to interact with backend APIs.

Features
1. Create Operation: Enable users to add new data to the API by submitting a form.
2. Read Operation: Display the existing data fetched from the API and render it on the user interface.
3. Update Operation: Allow users to modify existing data through an edit form and update it in the API.
4. Delete Operation: Provide functionality to remove data from the API by deleting it from the user interface.
5. Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle API request failures and display error messages to users.
6. Loading States: Show loading indicators while fetching or submitting data to provide feedback to users.
7. Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive, adapting its layout and styling based on the screen size for optimal viewing experience across devices.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React, Axios, Tailwind CSS
State Management: React Context API
Routing: React Router
Backend: Mock API
Deployment: Netlify

#File Structure
1. App.js: Main component responsible for rendering the navigation bar, routing, and managing the state of the application.
2. AddUser.js: Component for adding new users to the API.
3. EditUser.js: Component for editing existing user data.
4. UserList.js: Component for displaying the list of users fetched from the API.


# Usage
To use this application, clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn, and then run the development server. Once the server is running, the application can be accessed in a web browser. Make sure to configure the API base URL according to your mock API endpoint or backend server.

# Purpose
The purpose of the React Axios CRUD Application is to provide developers with a practical example of integrating Axios with React to perform CRUD operations in a frontend application. It serves as a learning resource for understanding how to make HTTP requests, handle responses, and manage API interactions in a React environment. Additionally, the project aims to demonstrate best practices for error handling, loading states, and responsive design in web applications. Developers can use this project as a reference for building their own CRUD applications or enhancing their skills in React and Axios integration.
